Topic: Hand Gesture Recognition for Document Reading

Requirements:
Hardware:
Arduino Nano 33 BLE + USB Cable
Latptop

Software:
Arduino IDE
Python IDE - Pyserial & PyAutoGUI
PDF Reader (Adoce Acrobat Reader)

Steps:
1. Open the Arduino IDE and include the ei-gestures-arduino-1.0.5.zip library. DONE
1. Upload the project.ino sketch to the Arduino Nano 33 BLE. DONE
2. Open the pdf_gesture_control.py file and run it. (make changes as necessary)

The py file opens the Adobe Reader application and the 4 gestures (up, down, circle and pan) perform different gestures: scroll up, down, zoom in and out and rotate clockwise.
