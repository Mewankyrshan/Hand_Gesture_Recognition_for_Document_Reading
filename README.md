## Topic: Hand Gesture Recognition for Document Reading
The project requires us to use hand gestures to document navigation. This can be achieved by using an accelerometer sensor such as the Arduno Nano 33 BLE which houses an in-built accelerometer.
This project uses the edge impulse website and tinyML techniques to train a model to use in the Arduino Nano 33 BLE to classify hand gestures. Using the pyserial and mouse and keyboard library, the laptop can read data from the arduino board via USB cable and perform keyboard and mouse functions for document navigation.

Requirements:
Hardware:
Arduino Nano 33 BLE + USB Cable
Latptop

Software:
Arduino IDE
Google Chrome
Python
